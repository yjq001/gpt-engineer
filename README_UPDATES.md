# GPT-Engineer Web Interface Updates

This document describes the updates made to the GPT-Engineer Web Interface.

## Changes Made

1. **Modular Route Structure**
   - Separated REST API and WebSocket routes into different files
   - Created a proper package structure with `routes` and `db` packages
   - Organized REST API routes by purpose (user.py, project.py, general.py)
   - Used consistent URL patterns (/api/user/*, /api/project/*)

2. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - Added a service layer for business logic separation
   - Created project_service.py for project-related operations
   - Improved code organization and maintainability
   - Added error handling to prevent crashes

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Added fallback implementations for gpt_engineer components
   - Improved error handling for database operations
   - Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application
   - Ensured the application can run even when some components are unavailable
   - Implemented logging system for better debugging and monitoring
   - Added OpenAI version compatibility check for gpt_engineer

4. **PostgreSQL Database Integration**
   - Added Peewee ORM for lightweight database operations
   - Created a User model with id and name fields
   - Added a REST API endpoint to get user by ID
   - Simplified database connection using a single DATABASE_URL
   - Added proper error handling for database operations
   - Removed SQLite dependencies to focus on PostgreSQL

5. **WebSocket Communication Improvements**
   - Enhanced WebSocket message handling with better error reporting
   - Added send_personal_message method for more consistent messaging
   - Improved token handling and code block processing
   - Added automatic code file saving functionality
   - Enhanced fallback implementation with realistic project generation

6. **Test Page for WebSocket and API Testing**
   - Created a comprehensive test page at `/test`
   - WebSocket testing panel with connect/disconnect functionality
   - REST API testing panel with endpoint selection and parameter input

7. **Removed Frontend Directory**
   - Removed the frontend directory
   - Using static directory for serving HTML and assets
   - Simplified the project structure

8. **Consolidated Server Files**
   - Combined the functionality into a single web_server.py file
   - Removed redundant web_server_new.py file
   - Simplified project maintenance

9. **Dependency Management**
   - Updated requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
   - Added python-logging for improved logging capabilities
   - Maintained compatibility with existing dependencies

## Database Configuration

The PostgreSQL database is configured with a single connection URL:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://etl:gf_etl_2023@etlpg.test.db.gf.com.cn/etl
```

This can be set in the `.env` file or as an environment variable. The default value is used if not specified.

## Fallback Implementations

The application includes fallback implementations for gpt_engineer components:

1. **GPT-Engineer Fallback**:
   - If gpt_engineer components are unavailable, fallback implementations are used
   - Project creation still works, generating simple placeholder files
   - All API endpoints remain functional even without gpt_engineer
   - Improved fallback implementation creates realistic project structure with README.md, main.py, and index.html
   - WebSocket communication provides real-time updates during fallback generation

2. **OpenAI Version Compatibility**:
   - The application checks OpenAI library version compatibility
   - Provides clear error messages when incompatible versions are detected
   - Gracefully falls back to alternative implementations
   - **Important**: gpt-engineer 0.0.9 requires OpenAI 0.27.8 specifically
   - To ensure compatibility, run: `pip install openai==0.27.8`
   - Newer versions of OpenAI (1.x+) are not compatible with gpt-engineer 0.0.9

## Running the Application

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
python web_server.py
```

3. Access the application:
   - Main application: http://localhost:8000/
   - Test page: http://localhost:8000/test

## API Endpoints

### REST API

- `POST /api/project/` - Create a new project
- `GET /api/project/{project_id}` - Get project details
- `GET /api/project/page/{project_id}` - Get project page
- `GET /api/user/{user_id}` - Get user by ID
- `GET /` - Main page
- `GET /test` - Test page

### WebSocket API

- `/ws/{project_id}` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication

## Testing

The test page at `/test` provides a user interface for testing both the REST API and WebSocket functionality:

1. **WebSocket Testing**:
   - Enter a project ID
   - Click "Connect" to establish a WebSocket connection
   - Send messages and view responses

2. **REST API Testing**:
   - Select an endpoint from the dropdown
   - Enter parameters in JSON format
   - Click "Send Request" to make the API call and view the response
